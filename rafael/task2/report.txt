A random range of values was introduce in package generator so that packages can have different sizes.
When trucks receive a package they cannot handle they return the package to the belt (that puts it at the front of the queue) and dispatchs,
when a truck is dispatched he will be replaced by a new truck that is spawned ina new process and carries over from where the other truck left.
Loging was enhanced to show that logic and how the space of the truck is filled.
