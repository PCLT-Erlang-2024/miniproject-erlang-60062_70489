A random delay between 1.5 and 3 seconds was added to the trucks dispacth logic to force a delay before a new truck is spawned.
As the system was already reliant on truck initiating the chain of events its already prepared for these changes.
The belt will only continue working when a new truck is spawned and start interacting with it.
The dispatch logic ensures trough BeltPid that the new truck will keep interacting with the belt assigned to the previous truck.
The design of the system ensures that even if we had a sized queue it would not overflow as no more request would be made while a truck was not ready to handle them.
