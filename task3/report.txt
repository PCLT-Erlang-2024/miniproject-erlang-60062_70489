A random delay between 1.5 and 3 seconds was introduced in the truck dispatch logic to simulate real-world delays before spawning 
a new truck. This delay ensures a more realistic workflow while maintaining system integrity. As trucks are the drivers of the process, 
this change does not disrupt the overall flow. The conveyor_belts remain idle until a new truck is spawned and begins interacting with 
its assigned belt.

The dispatch logic leverages the BeltPid to ensure that each newly spawned truck continues working with the same belt as its predecessor. 
This design guarantees smooth transitions and prevents request overflow, even if a bounded queue were used, as the belt will only handle 
new requests when a truck is available to process them. The system remains robust and efficient, handling asynchronous events while 
maintaining logical order.
